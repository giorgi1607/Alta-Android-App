With this project I tried to connect the Android application to one of the Georgian websites
called Alta.ge, the application brings information through web scraping and you can
more easily view posts, you can find electronics by categories, as well as "CRUD" your favorite
recipes in the local database for easy viewing. i have used jsoup . ANdroid PAGING,ROOM DATABASE , Kotlin COROUTINES and More ! you can check uploaded video below :) 
Because that pp uses web scrap the app works a bit slowly
